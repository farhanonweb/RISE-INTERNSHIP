CREATE PROC sp_SearchString
@String VARCHAR(20)
AS
BEGIN

WHERE EName like @string + '%'

--7. Create a stored procedure that calculates and returns the average salary of all employees in the Employee table.
CREATE PROC sp_averageSalary
AS
BEGIN
SELECT Avg(Esalary) AS AverageSalary FROM employee_info
END

--8. Create a stored procedure that takes two input parameters, MinSalary and MaxSalary, and returns all employees whose salary falls within that range.

@MinSalary INT,
@MaxSalary INT
AS
BEGIN
SELECT * FROM employee_info
WHERE Esalary between @MinSalary and @MaxSalary
